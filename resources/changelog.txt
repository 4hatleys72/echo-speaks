V2.0.0 Beta (November 30th, 2018):
▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔
App:
 • NEW: Completely rewritten to perform all server functions (except login proxy) via the SmartApp and Devices.
 • UPDATED: Much Better device capability verfication and identification support. If you try to use a command not supported the device logs will tell you.
 • ADDED: SmartApp supports being sent manual cookies via the Heroku Web Config 
 • ADDED: Change logs are visible in the SmartApp and when a new update is deployed

Device:
 • NEW: Rewritten to perform command functions of the Server. This means each device sends it's own commands directly to Amazon and securely handles the responses appropriately. 
 • UPDATE: Device detection is much more reliable and easier to maintain.
 • FIXED: So much I can't remember

Server:
 • UPDATED: No longer handles communication with Amazon (Polling or Commands). It's required only to handle the login process (This means it will be asleep unless you need to refresh your cookie)
 • ADDED: You can now paste your cookie and csrf strings into the web config page, which will send them up to ST.
