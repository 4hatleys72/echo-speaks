  • ADDED: New Zones Companion app.  You can now create groups of echo devices which you can be used in your actions.  They allow you to target speech based on device and location conditions.  So you only speak where your need to.
  • ADDED: WebSocket support: This only works on Hubitat and requires an additional driver be installed.
  • ADDED: Locale support for Brazil (amazon.com.br | pt-BR).
  • ADDED: LogTrace & LogDebug settings are automatically turned off after 6 hours now to reduce platform stress.

  • UPDATED: Guard Support checks are now performed as soon as the server is installed now to help eliminate the not supported or refresh page message.

  • UPDATED: Optimized and reduced the amount of repetitive web calls. I've made alot of state cleanups and consolidations.  Please make sure to open the app and press done immediately after updating your code.
  • FIXED: Resolved scenario where new server installs would result in the wrong Server preferences page being shown.  The page will show the login page when the server is installed and only login is required.

  • FIXED: Lots of UI text cleanups.
  • FIXED: Code cleanups and refactors.
